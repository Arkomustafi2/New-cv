        <p>Life become uncertain when you dreamed of something and eventually achieved it! If you are a person with just some of the dreams in life then if you achieve that then you will be just out of the track of your life. Life is a long journey and we have to plan big always. If you don't have any plan for the whole life then somewhere in your life you will be stucked just like me. So, plan before it is too late and work accordingly. *sigh* <br>
When I got admitted in Dhaka University then I was like living in my dreams. Sometimes, I was like in my dreams. I had no mentor to guide me through the harsh reality of life waiting in front. In the first semester, as a first year kid I skipped study and gossip and explored the new city. Then the corona came and we were in lockdown for a long time. I had no laptop then and I was just all alone with my mobile phone to pass my day in home. This created a long gap between myself and study. <br>
At that time I was getting a scholarship from the Alumni Association of EEE department and with this money and some savings from my mother I bought my first laptop. After that I was too much interested in technology and learned whatever I got. I learned several coding languages and setting up a laptop and etc. etc. But the gap between study and myself was so far. Another main reason was of this that when I came to learn enggineering I thought that there might be less things to memorize and much more practical. But the online class and the boaring theoris were draining me deep inside. As the global pandamic there were no exams but the classes were running on. <br>
When most of the people were vaccinated and the spreading of virus was decreasing the department call for the fist semester exam that we heave completed six months ago!! So the thing is that we have just finished the second semester but we have to give the first semester exam due to the administrative rule of DU. So, that time after finishing the second semester we have to roll back to the first semester exam. After the online first semester using the poor network of my home it was just a problem. After the first semester we got maybe one or some more days before the second semester exam in person in curzon hall. At that time I had no room to live in dhaka. So, I had to look for mess to live as there were no non-political seat in the hall. <br>
The adjustment in the envoironment of Dhaka was too much problamatic for me. Specially the food was one of the main problem. There were hotels but the price of food was high and not always hygenic. There was also no meal in the mess. So, I had to walk for nearly 1.5 km from my mess to Jagannath Hall for 2 meals.  That was really something that you can't just feel it. Not just meal, I had to take water from my campus as the mess water was not drinkable at all. As I came from a middle class family, so I had to took a fixed amount of money that I need to survive. So, I never tried to pressurize them to send more. As the first year was mostly online, so I started to make friends after the starting of second year. As I don't like the traditional theory based academics, I started to spend time in volunteering activities. <br>
For volunteering, I joined the Dhaka University Rover Scout Group. I was the only member from engineering faculty there. I enjoyed learning and working with people from different departments. The most exciting part was the duty on 21st February, each of us enjoyed the time very much. The second volunteering group was IEEE. I started as a member as finished as the Treasurer of IEEE SB DU. When I joined IEEE, I tried to explore the oppurtunities provided by IEEE. I was certainly able to use some of this oppurtunities and win gifts and rewards. Then I explore the IEEE Collabratec and there was a gorup called IEEE Puzzlers. I liked to solve their puzzles and wanted to join them. So, eventually I got the chance to join then and I took it. There I made many puzzles and got the chance to meet with some amazing persons. So, in this way my volunteering life was good enough. <br>
