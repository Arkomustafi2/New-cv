        <p>I am a simple student who came to University of Dhaka form a family where noone else have completed his education from any public or private university. When I was in class 10, I dreamed big. I dreamed to get admission into a good collage that I can go to a good university. Obviously, I was not aware of the university or subjects then. I have got board scholarship in all the board exams. <br>

After the admission test, I got admitted into University of Dhaka, a dream university for everyone. But things started to change very rapidly and I was not able to cope with all the things. Dhaka is totally different from Rajshahi. I tried to do my best to adopt in this city and with the totally new english curriculam. <br>

In the meantime Covid-19 spread all over the world and there was a huge gap in study. Though I have used the time for skill development but there is no impact of it in my academics. I have learnt web developing, some hacking tricks, how to boot windows, setup a PC and many. I don't personally like the teaching style and system in DU. If you don't read you will get bad grades, but if you get bad CGPA in DU EEE you will continuously getting bad grades. In first two years, I was barely serious in my studies. I like to read books, meeting new friends, engaging in differnt volunteering activities and also I was in a relationship.<br>

From class five to intermediate, I have never failed to get a board scholarship. So, I haven't taste the bad result in academics. But, in university I have to taste bad grades from the second semester. After every semester I have tried to find my fault and solve that but for some reason, I was not able to cut a good grade. So, the pressure was immense on me to prove myself, but I failed again & again. In the darkest days of life, we can find who will be there for us in any situation. She left me when I needed her the most. That was also a period to overcome this and also to fight back in my seat. <br>

In the last semester, I have tried my best to do well in exam but surprisingly I have got bad grades again. In two courses I have thought to get 4 but got only 3. In another 2 course I have got evern worse but I gave good exam. So, there is noone to blame, I think God's plan is the best plan.
